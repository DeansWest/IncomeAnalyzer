# Want to set up a Python server that will provide a form and generate a view. Or provide a backend service to a single page application.
# I already have a demostratable version running on a Java server...

# http://env-3916994.jelastic.servint.net/IncomeAnalyser/                ....  demonstration (when server is up and running)
# http://www.deans.us/infoscope/projects_main/project-income-analyzer    ....  blog for more details
# https://ndeans.beanstalkapp.com/cloud_svn1/browse/IncomeAnalyser/trunk ....  SVN Java source

# ...but it isn't 100% functional. Some results depend on hardcoded values. 

# 1. Port Java to Python
# 2. Search for web services that can be used to replace hard coded values
# 3. Complete code in Python.
